# PolyNetSDK
PolyNetSDK xcframework integration guide
This project is the PolyNet SDK for iOS and tvOS. It is written in Swift 5 and supports Swift 6.

# Platforms Requirements
The PolyNet SDK is compatible with iOS 12.0 or higher and tvOS 12.0 or higher. macOS is not supported by now.
# Versions
The PolyNetSDK conforms to the Semantic Versioning 2.0.0. The version 5.0.0 is the first to use this standard competely, because version 4 used a partial of this.

# Targets
PolyNetSDK_iOS: This is the main target of the iOS Dynamic Framework, used in development.

PolyNetSDK_iOS_Test: This target is needed for iOS unit testing.

PolyNetSDK_tvOS: This is the main target of the tvOS Dynamic Framework, used in development.

PolyNetSDK_tvOS_Test: This target is needed for tvOS unit testing.

PolyNetSDK_XCFramework: This target is used to build the XCFramework.
# Swift ABI and Module Stability
The PolyNet SDK is build with BUILD_FOR_DISTRIBUTION to YES, so the framework is forward compatible with Swift compilers. Backwards compatibility with older Swift version compilers are not guarantee.
# XCFramework
The project uses the target PolyNetSDK_XCFramework to build an xcframework with the following architectures:

arm64 iOS devices.
x86_64 for iOS simulators.
arm64 for tvOS devices.
x86_64 for tvOS simulators.
arm64 for iOS simulators are supported now and for tvOS simulators (simulators running on M1 & M2 silicon) are supported only through Rosetta.


Requirements
iOS 12.0+ and tvOS 12.0+

Swift 5.6+

Xcode 13+ (for Swift Package Manager integration)

Installation
Using Swift Package Manager
To add PolyNetSDK to your project using Swift Package Manager, add the following dependency in your Package.swift:

swift
Copy
Edit
.package(url: "https://your-git-provider.com/your-org/PolyNetSPM.git", from: "5.2.0")
Alternatively, you can add it through Xcode:

Open your Xcode project.

Go to File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency.

Enter the URL for the Git repository:
https://your-git-provider.com/your-org/PolyNetSPM.git

Choose the version 5.2.0 or higher.

Using Nexus (Binary Integration)
The SDK is available as a precompiled binary, so itâ€™s integrated through the Package.swift as a binary target. You can use the following URL to access the SDK:

swift
Copy
Edit
.binaryTarget(
    name: "PolyNetSDK",
    url: "https://your-nexus-domain.com/repository/your-private-repo/PolyNetSDK.xcframework.zip",
    checksum: "9cb83606e31349d63703e583aee92c9a3c1028f534d700f66b40bb9b37ad70d6"
)
Usage
Example
Hereâ€™s how you can import and use PolyNetSDK in your project:

swift
Copy
Edit
import PolyNetSDK
import SwiftProtobuf
import Starscream

// Example usage of the SDK
func setupWebRTC() {
    // Initialize WebRTC client
    let client = WebRTCClient()
    client.setupConnection()

    // Use Starscream for WebSocket communication
    let socket = WebSocket(url: URL(string: "wss://example.com/socket")!)
    socket.connect()

    // Handle Protobuf data
    let protobufMessage = SomeMessage()
    let data = try! protobufMessage.serializedData()
}
