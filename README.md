PolyNetSDK is a Swift package that provides advanced networking functionality for iOS and tvOS platforms. This SDK is designed to facilitate WebRTC communication and includes features such as:

WebRTC integration

Protobuf support

WebSocket support with Starscream

Features
WebRTC Support: Provides the foundation for real-time communication.

Protobuf: For efficient serialization of structured data.

WebSockets (via Starscream): Used for real-time, bidirectional communication.

Requirements
iOS 12.0+ and tvOS 12.0+

Swift 5.6+

Xcode 13+ (for Swift Package Manager integration)

Installation
Using Swift Package Manager
To add PolyNetSDK to your project using Swift Package Manager, add the following dependency in your Package.swift:

swift
Copy
Edit
.package(url: "https://your-git-provider.com/your-org/PolyNetSPM.git", from: "5.2.0")
Alternatively, you can add it through Xcode:

Open your Xcode project.

Go to File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency.

Enter the URL for the Git repository:
https://your-git-provider.com/your-org/PolyNetSPM.git

Choose the version 5.2.0 or higher.

Using Nexus (Binary Integration)
The SDK is available as a precompiled binary, so itâ€™s integrated through the Package.swift as a binary target. You can use the following URL to access the SDK:

swift
Copy
Edit
.binaryTarget(
    name: "PolyNetSDK",
    url: "https://your-nexus-domain.com/repository/your-private-repo/PolyNetSDK.xcframework.zip",
    checksum: "9cb83606e31349d63703e583aee92c9a3c1028f534d700f66b40bb9b37ad70d6"
)
Usage
Example
Hereâ€™s how you can import and use PolyNetSDK in your project:

swift
Copy
Edit
import PolyNetSDK
import SwiftProtobuf
import Starscream

// Example usage of the SDK
func setupWebRTC() {
    // Initialize WebRTC client
    let client = WebRTCClient()
    client.setupConnection()

    // Use Starscream for WebSocket communication
    let socket = WebSocket(url: URL(string: "wss://example.com/socket")!)
    socket.connect()

    // Handle Protobuf data
    let protobufMessage = SomeMessage()
    let data = try! protobufMessage.serializedData()
}
